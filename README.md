Easily deploy to Debian / Ubuntu sip video and chat server

## Installer

Run the installer.sh

## Why

I wanted a way to setup a chat/video server very quickly using SIP protocol. There are a few current open providers like kamailio, [FreeSwitch](https://freeswitch.com/), [Asterisk](https://www.asterisk.org/), etc. I ended up going with kamailio. Their own [documentation](https://kamailio.org/docs/tutorials/devel/kamailio-install-guide-deb/) is really good and it worked fine out of the box on digitalocean.
